description: 'Four non-human primates were used for this study in two contemporaneous
  cohorts. One cohort (n=3 hemispheres) was implanted with the Medtronic RC+S stimulation
  (GIN cohort) and recording system connected to two 4-contact ring electrodes to
  evaluate three unilateral stimulation patterns: 7 Hz Ring ADMES, 20 Hz Dual Ring,
  and 125 Hz Dual Ring (analog of clinical stimulation). In an additional cohort (EPC
  cohort, n=2), two 12-contact segmented electrodes were implanted in the right hippocampus
  and connected to an externalized recording and stimulation system to allow more
  flexibility in the stimulation pattern. In this second cohort, 4 variations of stimulation
  were evaluated (7 Hz Full ADMES, 7 Hz Ring ADMES, 31 Hz Wide Ring, and 31 Hz Dual
  Ring).  '
